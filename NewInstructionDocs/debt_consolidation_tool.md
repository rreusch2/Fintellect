# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Debt Consolidation Tool

## 1. Objective
To provide Fintellect users (potentially premium tier) with an intelligent tool that analyzes their debt situation and provides personalized, data-driven recommendations for consolidation and management strategies.

## 2. Core Technology
*   **Backend Logic:** [Chosen backend language/framework].
*   **Machine Learning:** ML models (e.g., using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch) for analyzing debt profiles, predicting payoff timelines, and matching users to optimal consolidation products/strategies. Potential use of Relevance AI for specific analysis tasks if beneficial.
*   **Data Integration:** APIs like Plaid or Finicity for users to optionally connect accounts and automatically import debt data. Manual input option required.
*   **Frontend:** Interactive UI within Fintellect for data input and displaying recommendations.

## 3. Key Capabilities
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Manual entry of debt details (Creditor, Balance, Interest Rate (APR), Minimum Payment).
    *   Optional secure connection via Plaid/Finicity to automatically fetch loan, credit card balances, and terms.
*   **Debt Analysis:**
    *   Calculates total debt, overall blended interest rate, estimated payoff time with minimum payments.
    *   Identifies high-interest debts.
    *   Categorizes debt types (credit card, personal loan, student loan, auto, mortgage etc.).
*   **Consolidation Strategy Recommendation:**
    *   Analyzes user's profile (imported/inputted data, maybe credit score range if provided/inferred).
    *   Recommends suitable strategies:
        *   Debt Consolidation Loans (Personal Loans).
        *   Balance Transfer Credit Cards (considering promo periods and fees).
        *   Home Equity Loan / HELOC (if applicable homeowner).
        *   Debt Management Plans (via non-profits - provide info/links).
        *   Debt Snowball vs. Debt Avalanche payoff methods simulated based on user's debts.
    *   Provides estimated new monthly payment, total interest paid, and time-to-debt-free for each viable option compared to current situation.
*   **Product Matching (Optional/Advanced):**
    *   If feasible/desired, integrate with affiliate marketplaces or APIs to show potential loan/card offers based on user profile (requires careful compliance and transparency).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Clear dashboard summarizing current debt situation.
    *   Interactive tools to compare consolidation scenarios.
    *   Secure forms for data entry.
    *   Educational content about debt management strategies.

## 4. Value Proposition
*   Simplifies complex debt situations.
*   Provides clear, actionable, personalized recommendations.
*   Helps users potentially save money on interest.
*   Empowers users to take control of their debt.
*   Reduces financial stress through better planning.

## 5. Technical Considerations
*   Security: Extremely high importance for handling sensitive financial data (encryption, secure API practices, compliance like SOC2 if needed).
*   Accuracy: Ensure calculations for interest, payoff times, and potential savings are precise.
*   API Integration: Robust handling of Plaid/Finicity API connections, including user consent management and error handling.
*   ML Model: Training/selection of appropriate models for recommendation. Consider fairness and bias. Explainability of recommendations is important.
*   User Experience: Must be intuitive and build trust. Avoid overly technical jargon.
