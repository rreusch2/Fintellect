## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Integration complexity between TypeScript and Python | High | Medium | Use standardized API formats (JSON) and thorough testing |
| Performance issues with real-time updates | Medium | Medium | Implement efficient WebSocket communication and optimize data transfer |
| Docker sandbox security concerns | High | Low | Implement proper isolation and security best practices |
| API compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Create adapter layer and version API endpoints |

### Project Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Build in buffer time and prioritize critical features |
| Resource constraints | High | Low | Clearly define roles and responsibilities, consider external resources if needed |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Maintain strict change control process and prioritize requirements |
| Technical debt | Medium | Medium | Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions |

## Success Criteria

The integration will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create research profiles and run the Sentinel Research Agent
2. The agent can perform research tasks using the OpenManus integration
3. Users can view real-time updates of the agent's activities in the UI
4. The sandbox environment is visible and understandable to users
5. Research results are properly stored and accessible
6. The system performs reliably with acceptable response times

## Next Steps

1. Secure approval for the integration plan
2. Allocate resources and set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Schedule regular progress reviews and adjust plan as needed
