# Feature Specification: Sentinel (Autonomous Research Intelligence Agent - ARIA)

## 1. Objective
To provide Fintellect premium users with a powerful, autonomous AI agent (Sentinel) that performs scheduled, customized research across markets, news, and diverse data sources, delivering timely, actionable intelligence and identifying potential opportunities or risks.

## 2. Core Technology
*   **Agent Framework:** ARIA running on MCP Servers.
*   **Orchestration:** ARIA handles scheduling, task execution, data fetching coordination, and results aggregation.
*   **Analysis Components:** May utilize specific ML/NLP libraries/services (e.g., Relevance AI, Transformers) invoked by ARIA for tasks like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, summarization, trend detection.

## 3. Key Capabilities
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Runs independently based on user-defined schedules or triggers.
*   **Scheduling:**
    *   Intervals: Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Custom Cron expressions.
    *   Event-Triggers: Pre-market open, Post-market close, Specific economic data releases.
    *   Continuous Monitoring Option: "Always-on" for high-priority topics (resource-intensive, premium tier?).
*   **Research Task Definition (User Input):**
    *   Topics/Keywords: User-defined terms, company names, tickers.
    *   Asset Classes: Equities, ETFs, Crypto, Commodities, Forex.
    *   Data Sources: User selection/prioritization from available sources (News feeds, regulatory filings, market data, blogs, etc.).
    *   Analysis Types: Sentiment, Volume spikes, Price action anomalies, Keyword co-occurrence, Trend analysis, Summarization.
    *   Alerting Conditions: User-defined thresholds (e.g., "Sentiment score change > X%", "Volume > Y * 90-day average").
*   **Data Sources Integration (via ARIA):**
    *   Market Data APIs (real-time/delayed price, volume).
    *   Premium & Standard News APIs.
    *   SEC EDGAR Database (Filings like 8-K, 10-K/Q).
    *   Financial Blogs / RSS Feeds.
    *   [Optional Premium] Social Media Sentiment Feeds (e.g., Stocktwits, Twitter - filtered).
    *   [Optional Premium] Economic Calendars / Indicator APIs.
*   **Analysis Performed by ARIA (using components):**
    *   Sentiment Analysis (on news, filings, social).
    *   Entity Recognition (Companies, People, Tickers).
    *   Event Detection (Earnings, M&A, Legal issues from text).
    *   Summarization (of articles, reports).
    *   Anomaly Detection (in price, volume, sentiment).
    *   Basic Trend Analysis & Correlation (e.g., Sector sentiment vs. price movement).
*   **Output & Delivery:**
    *   Dedicated Sentinel section in Fintellect dashboard.
    *   Digest summaries (daily/weekly).
    *   Real-time alerts (configurable delivery: in-app notification, email, SMS?).
    *   Downloadable reports (CSV, PDF).
    *   Visualization of trends/sentiment over time.

## 4. Premium Differentiators
*   Access to a wider range of premium data sources.
*   More complex analysis types (e.g., cross-asset correlations, predictive indicators - use cautiously).
*   Higher frequency monitoring options ("Always-on").
*   More sophisticated customization of research tasks and alerting.
*   Ability to handle a larger number of concurrent research tasks.
*   Generation of more in-depth, synthesized reports.

## 5. Technical Considerations
*   Scalability of ARIA/MCP infrastructure to handle multiple users/agents.
*   Rate limiting and costs associated with external APIs.
*   Secure handling of API keys and user data.
*   Robust error handling and monitoring for agent tasks.
*   Isolated execution environments for each agent/task if necessary (as originally suggested, good practice).
*   User Interface for configuring tasks and viewing results.
