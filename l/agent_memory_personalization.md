# Agent Memory and Personalization System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for an enhanced agent memory system and personalization framework for Fintellect's premium AI services. The system will enable agents to maintain contextual awareness of user information, preferences, and history while presenting distinct personalities that users can connect with.

## Memory Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Knowledge Store**
   - **Purpose**: Central repository for persistent user information
   - **Structure**:
     - Hierarchical data organization with categorized information
     - Temporal metadata for all stored information
     - Importance scoring system for prioritization
     - Source attribution for data provenance
   - **Implementation**:
     - Extend current Knowledge Store with improved schema
     - Add versioning for tracking information changes
     - Implement data validation and consistency checks

2. **Vector Database Layer**
   - **Purpose**: Semantic storage and retrieval of unstructured information
   - **Structure**:
     - Embedding storage for conversations and insights
     - Similarity search capabilities for contextual retrieval
     - Clustering for identifying related information
   - **Implementation**:
     - Integration with Pinecone, Weaviate, or similar vector database
     - Automatic embedding generation for all agent interactions
     - Relevance scoring for retrieval optimization

3. **User Profile System**
   - **Purpose**: Structured storage of explicit user attributes
   - **Structure**:
     - Core financial attributes (income, expenses, assets, liabilities)
     - Preference profiles (risk tolerance, financial priorities)
     - Goal registry with progress tracking
     - Life event timeline
   - **Implementation**:
     - Dedicated database tables with relational structure
     - Automatic update mechanisms based on new information
     - Confidence scoring for inferred attributes

4. **Conversation Memory Manager**
   - **Purpose**: Maintain relevant conversation history and insights
   - **Structure**:
     - Short-term memory for recent interactions
     - Long-term memory for important insights
     - Conversation summarization for context compression
   - **Implementation**:
     - Sliding window approach for recent conversations
     - Automatic extraction of key insights
     - Periodic consolidation of conversation history

### Memory Operations

1. **Information Capture**
   - Explicit information from user inputs
   - Implicit information inferred from transactions and behavior
   - Derived insights from agent analysis
   - External data integration (Plaid, market data)

2. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Context-aware retrieval based on current conversation
   - Proactive surfacing of relevant information
   - Confidence-weighted information presentation
   - Cross-agent memory sharing with privacy controls

3. **Memory Maintenance**
   - Periodic review and consolidation of information
   - Conflict resolution for contradictory information
   - Importance decay for aging information
   - User-initiated memory correction

## Personalization Framework

### Agent Persona System

1. **Persona Definition**
   - **Financial Planning Agent**:
     - Name: "Horizon"
     - Personality: Thoughtful, forward-thinking, nurturing
     - Communication style: Calm, methodical, encouraging
     - Visual theme: Deep blue with gold accents, horizon imagery
   
   - **Investment Advisor Agent**:
     - Name: "Vertex"
     - Personality: Analytical, precise, confident
     - Communication style: Data-driven, clear, authoritative
     - Visual theme: Green with graphical elements, upward trends
   
   - **Expense Optimization Agent**:
     - Name: "Thrive"
     - Personality: Resourceful, practical, detail-oriented
     - Communication style: Direct, actionable, supportive
     - Visual theme: Purple with efficiency-focused iconography
   
   - **Financial Goal Tracking Agent**:
     - Name: "Summit"
     - Personality: Motivational, energetic, supportive
     - Communication style: Encouraging, celebratory, coaching
     - Visual theme: Orange with milestone/journey imagery

2. **Persona Implementation**
   - Consistent language patterns for each agent
   - Agent-specific templates for common interactions
   - Personality-driven response generation
   - Visual design system with agent-specific elements

3. **Persona Evolution**
   - Progressive relationship development based on interaction history
   - Adaptation to user communication preferences
   - Milestone-based relationship deepening
   - User-controlled persona customization options

### Personalization Engine

1. **User Preference Learning**
   - Interaction style preferences (detailed vs. concise)
   - Communication frequency preferences
   - Visual presentation preferences
   - Feature usage pattern analysis

2. **Adaptive Interfaces**
   - Dynamic UI adjustments based on user behavior
   - Personalized dashboard configurations
   - Adaptive information density
   - Context-sensitive help and guidance

3. **Content Personalization**
   - Tailored financial insights based on user interests
   - Personalized educational content
   - Custom notification strategies
   - Individualized goal suggestions
