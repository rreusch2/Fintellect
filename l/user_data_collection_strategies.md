# User Data Collection Strategies for Fintellect

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive strategies for collecting additional user data beyond transaction history to enhance the personalization and effectiveness of Fintellect's AI agents. These approaches are designed to be user-friendly, value-driven, and privacy-conscious.

5. **User Control** - Give users ownership over their data and how it's used
