      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the directory creation process into individual steps for frontend and backend, including the creation of placeholder files and README documents.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, involving mostly file system operations. The complexity is low, but it requires attention to detail in creating the correct structure."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Frontend Dependencies",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for identifying, adding, and testing each new dependency, including version conflict resolution and import statement updates.",
      "reasoning": "While not highly complex, this task requires careful management of dependencies and potential conflicts. It involves both addition of new packages and modification of existing code."

      "taskTitle": "Define Database Schema with Drizzle ORM",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema definition into separate subtasks for each table, including the creation of migration files and testing of foreign key relationships.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a database schema, which requires careful consideration of data relationships and future scalability. The use of Drizzle ORM adds some complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Access Layer (DAL)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the DAL implementation into separate functions for each table, including CRUD operations and any complex queries or transactions.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive DAL is complex due to the need for efficient and secure database operations, error handling, and ensuring type safety with TypeScript."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the middleware implementation into steps for integrating with existing auth, handling different authentication scenarios, and type definitions.",
      "reasoning": "While building on existing authentication, this task requires careful integration and consideration of security implications. The complexity is moderate."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Client-Side Authentication Context",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for creating the context, integrating with existing hooks, removing Supabase code, and updating components to use the new context.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both creating new authentication context and refactoring existing components, which requires careful consideration of state management and component interactions."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement File Storage System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the file storage implementation into subtasks for middleware creation, API endpoint development, database integration, and security considerations.",
      "reasoning": "File handling involves multiple components (server, database, file system) and requires careful consideration of security and performance, making it a more complex task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Proxy API Layer",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the API implementation into separate endpoints for conversations, messages, and agent interactions, including error handling and authentication checks.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive API layer involves multiple endpoints, error handling, and integration with the DAL and authentication system, resulting in moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker configuration update into steps for modifying docker-compose.yml, creating Dockerfile, setting up environment variables, and testing the configuration.",
      "reasoning": "While Docker configuration is not highly complex, it requires attention to detail and understanding of the application's infrastructure needs."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks for different areas of integration testing (auth, conversations, files, Docker), and separate documentation tasks for each major component.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive integration testing and documentation is a complex task that requires deep understanding of all system components and their interactions, as well as the ability to clearly communicate this information."
