**Relevance Score:** 49.6%

**Summary:** Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It is often measured from either the standard deviation or variance between those returns. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.

In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big price swings either up or down. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than 1% over a sustained period of time, it is called a volatile market. [...] Volatility is how much and how quickly prices move over a given span of time. In the stock market, increased volatility is often a sign of fear and uncertainty among investors. This is why the VIX volatility index is sometimes called the “fear index.”

At the same time, volatility can create opportunities for day traders to enter and exit positions. Volatility is also a key component in options pricing and trading.
