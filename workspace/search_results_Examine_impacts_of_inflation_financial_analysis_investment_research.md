[...] *   1.
    
    Higher rates of inflation are associated with greater inflation and stock return variability.
    
*   2.
    
    Higher inflation implies less long-run financial activity. In economies with high inflation, intermediaries will lend less and allocate capital less effectively, and equity markets will be smaller and less liquid.
