Appendices

Appendix I: List of Sectors [...] While this research focused on the impacts of a short list of macroeconomic variables, we acknowledge that sector performance is influenced by many variables beyond the ones analyzed. This includes other economic variables, industry-specific secular trends, valuations, monetary policy, and short-term market sentiment. [...] The goal of our research here is to identify sectors and industries that have greater performance sensitivity to specific macroeconomic variables.
