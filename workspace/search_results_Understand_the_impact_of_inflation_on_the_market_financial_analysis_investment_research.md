Thus, we employ data on inflation, banking sector activity, equity market size, equity market liquidity, and the rates of return on stocks for up to 100 countries [...] *   1.

## Related Investment Articles [...] The impact of inflation on [investments](/investments) depends on the investment type. For investments with a set annual return, like regular bonds or bank certificates of deposit, inflation can hurt performance — since you earn the same interest payment each year, it can cut into your earnings. If you receive a payment of $100 per year, for instance, that payment would be worth less and less each year given inflation. [...] On the other hand, investments in certain commodities such as oil, agricultural goods, and precious metals historically do well when inflation is high. While these commodity prices can significantly impact inflation, their rise in price can help to maintain purchasing power as an investment vehicle and are often used as a hedge against inflation. As the value of the dollar goes down, it costs more dollars to buy the same amount of product.
