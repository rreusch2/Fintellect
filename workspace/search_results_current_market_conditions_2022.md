**Summary:** This past year was not only a difficult one for stocks and bonds, but also for "alternative assets" such as crypto. Rising interest rates impacted the viability of crypto. Couple this with revelations of fraud and abuse, and crypto assets have fallen precipitously. [...] While overall inflationary pressures may have peaked as we close out 2022, food and energy prices remain elevated. Energy prices led the price surge at the beginning of the year. Crude oil prices rose to more than $110.00 per barrel for the first time since 2011. Energy prices, which were already rising at the end of 2021, were sent soaring following the Russian invasion of Ukraine as Russian refining capacity diminished amidst sanctions and trade restrictions imposed by several countries. [...] Early in 2022, the Federal Reserve expected inflation to reach 2.6% by the end of the year, not much above their 2.0% target. Federal officials expected supply bottlenecks to ease, economies to re-open after relaxing COVID-related restrictions, and economic activity to return to something close to normal.

**Relevance Score:** 54.3%

**Summary:** the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. As these headwinds played out in 2022, the equity market dropped as much as 22% before bottoming out in October. [...] However, while our price/fair value metric at the end of July was 1.03, representing a 3% premium to a composite of our valuations, today we think investors should remain at a market-weight position in their portfolios. The situation now is much different than the one in 2022. Of those four factors, three are currently tailwinds and only one remains a headwind.

## Inflation [...] Steady as she goes. With the broad equity market trading just a little over fair value, we advocate for investors to position themselves at a market weight within their targeted long-term asset allocations between equity and fixed income. With the rate of economic growth projected to slow for the next few quarters, stock markets could become increasingly volatile this summer and pullbacks could provide an opportunity to move back to overweight equity positions.

**Relevance Score:** 54.0%

**Summary:** Loosening labor market slack has allowed wage growth to moderate. After peaking at 7.0% in March 2022, wage growth has slowed back to trend with wages for private production and non-supervisory workers rising 4.1% year over year in February, just above the 50-year average. While slower immigration could put upward pressure on wages, sustained strong productivity gains should help limit any pass-through to inflation.
