**Relevance Score:** 63.8%

**Summary:** This past year was not only a difficult one for stocks and bonds, but also for "alternative assets" such as crypto. Rising interest rates impacted the viability of crypto. Couple this with revelations of fraud and abuse, and crypto assets have fallen precipitously. [...] While overall inflationary pressures may have peaked as we close out 2022, food and energy prices remain elevated. Energy prices led the price surge at the beginning of the year. Crude oil prices rose to more than $110.00 per barrel for the first time since 2011. Energy prices, which were already rising at the end of 2021, were sent soaring following the Russian invasion of Ukraine as Russian refining capacity diminished amidst sanctions and trade restrictions imposed by several countries. [...] Early in 2022, the Federal Reserve expected inflation to reach 2.6% by the end of the year, not much above their 2.0% target. Federal officials expected supply bottlenecks to ease, economies to re-open after relaxing COVID-related restrictions, and economic activity to return to something close to normal.

## Result 3: 2022 Global Market Outlook | Russell Investments

**Relevance Score:** 61.2%

**Summary:** # 2022 Global Market Outlook: The great moderation

We believe global growth will be slower in 2022 than 2021, but still above trend. Amid this backdrop, we think equities should outperform bonds. In addition, while inflation has yet to peak, we believe it will likely decline over the year. As a result, we expect any tightening by central banks in 2022 will be modest.

## **Key market themes** [...] We expect Europe to head into 2022 with healthy growth momentum, with business surveys showing broad-based gains across countries and sectors, and fiscal policy set to provide persistent support to growth. We believe that the MSCI EMU Index, which reflects the European Economic and Monetary Union, has the potential to outperform the S&P 500® Index in the coming quarters. [...] In Japan, inflation has remained very subdued, due to softer demand and less challenge with supply chains. We do expect a very modest increase in inflation through 2022, given that import prices have been rising. However, this is unlikely to pose a challenge to the Bank of Japan, which we believe will lag other central banks in raising interest rates.

**Relevance Score:** 54.0%

**Summary:** Loosening labor market slack has allowed wage growth to moderate. After peaking at 7.0% in March 2022, wage growth has slowed back to trend with wages for private production and non-supervisory workers rising 4.1% year over year in February, just above the 50-year average. While slower immigration could put upward pressure on wages, sustained strong productivity gains should help limit any pass-through to inflation.
