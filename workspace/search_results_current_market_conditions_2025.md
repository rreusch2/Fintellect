**Summary:** The negative fundamentals for stock returns in 2025 include:

**An ending rate-cut cycle**: We currently project rates to bottom out at 3.00%, slightly lower than current market projections. The timing of rate cuts priced by the markets is similar to our projection, which means the equity market may start to anticipate tightening. However, regardless of the final level for the federal funds rate, stocks may be skittish as the end of the cycle for lower rates approaches in late 2025. [...] If current market conditions hold, the Russell 2000 will have underperformed the S&P 500 in eight of the last 10 years. A common belief about small-cap stocks is that they outperform large-cap stocks over the long term. This has not been the case over the past 10 years and the performance gap is narrowing. Either small-cap stocks need to play some catch-up with large caps or the small-cap outperformance thesis needs to be revisited. This coming year may be a pivotal one with respect to this

**Relevance Score:** 73.6%

**Summary:** **Fabio Bassi:** Now that my colleagues have shared their views, I’d like to wrap up this episode with some projections across different asset classes in 2025. So to summarize, for 2025, we are positive on risky assets with a strong preference for U.S. equities. In rates, we expect uneven normalization that is going to create cross-market opportunity with more confidence in the disinflation process, in the euro area and in the reflation narrative in Japan. We remain positive on the dollar, [...] **Dubravko Lakos-Bujas:** Looking at 2025, we think the global equity backdrop will likely be quite fluid with a lot of cross-currents at the forefront. We think big picture, the theme will be about dispersion. Dispersion is driven both by top down as well as bottom up forces. Top down forces being basically what I would call unsynchronized business cycles. You know, countries that are facing disinflation at different sort of rates and pace and uh, bottoms up. We're just basically I think [...] In light of these factors, the current polarized regional equity performance will likely persist going into 2025, with U.S. equities preferred over eurozone and EM. For the S&P 500, J.P. Morgan Research estimates a price target of 6,500 next year, with EPS of $270.

## Result 5: Stock Market Outlook: Bull Market May Not Be Finished

**URL:** https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/stock-market-outlook-2025-q2-update
**Source:** morganstanley.com
**Relevance Score:** 67.6%

**Summary:** Overall, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Applied Equity Team maintains that 2025 is likely to be a “pause” year for the S&P 500, delivering single-digit gains for investors. This is consistent with [our outlook](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/stock-market-outlook-2025) at the beginning of the year, which suggested that the third year of a bull market usually will produce mediocre—but still positive—returns, along with greater volatility.
