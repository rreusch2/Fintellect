**Source:** fidelity.com
**Relevance Score:** 55.0%

**Summary:** For 2025 and beyond, I believe the sector is still well positioned. Tech has continued to be the source of the most exciting advances in how we work and live. The impacts of generative AI may be unfolding for many years to come, as may the increased digitization and automation of our lives—all of which could continue to drive results for the semiconductor makers, software makers, and other companies that populate this sector. [...] **Past performance is no guarantee of future results.** Technology sector performance is represented by the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Data as of December 9, 2024. Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of S&P Global.

### 2025: Compelling near-term dynamics for semiconductors [...] Although some semiconductor stocks have been at the forefront of the tech sector’s big gains in recent years, the chip industry has actually been bifurcated over this period. The stocks of companies linked to AI, like NVIDIA (), have enjoyed surging fundamentals. But those that serve more broad-based end markets—like autos, industrial products, communications infrastructure, and consumer electronics—have actually lagged, in many cases, due to severe oversupply problems.
