Bankrate staff insight

“It’s important to make sure you match your investments with your financial goals. Stocks are a great choice for long-term goals, but their volatility makes them risky in the short term. Bonds may be safer in the near term, but are unlikely to generate returns that will help you reach long-term goals such as retirement.” [...] There are many ways to invest — from safe choices such as high-yield savings accounts and CDs to medium-risk options such as [corporate bonds](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/corporate-bonds/), and even higher-risk picks such as stock index funds. That’s great news because it means you can find investments that offer a variety of returns and fit your risk profile. It also means that you can combine investments to create a well-rounded and diversified — that is, safer — portfolio.
