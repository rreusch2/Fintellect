**Summary:** Investors may wonder which investment vehicle is better—a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). As ETF assets grow, industry participants continue to debate the merits of one vehicle over the other. While the ETF versus mutual fund debate has many angles, one stands out: should investors consider a manager’s underlying investment strategy when comparing ETFs versus mutual funds in areas such as how investor activity is managed, how frequently holdings disclosures are required, and tax [...] Debates about the pros and cons of investment vehicle types are important.
