**Relevance Score:** 74.1%

**Summary:** Investors may wonder which investment vehicle is better—a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). As ETF assets grow, industry participants continue to debate the merits of one vehicle over the other. While the ETF versus mutual fund debate has many angles, one stands out: should investors consider a manager’s underlying investment strategy when comparing ETFs versus mutual funds in areas such as how investor activity is managed, how frequently holdings disclosures are required, and tax [...] ## Investor Choice

Debates about the pros and cons of investment vehicle types are important. Vehicle type can have an impact on cost, tax efficiency, and transparency—considerations that may be meaningful to many investors. We believe these arguments should be carefully considered in the context of the manager’s approach. In Dimensional’s case, we can offer a similar investment approach in a mutual fund or an ETF, providing our clients a choice in how they can access our investment offering. [...] ETFs and mutual funds also differ in how frequently holdings are required to be publicly disclosed. Most ETFs are fully transparent, meaning they disclose their holdings on a daily basis with a one-day lag. By comparison, most mutual funds are generally required to publish holdings with a 30-day lag. Publishing holdings daily should not present a limitation for indexing strategies, as they are designed to track a published index, and index holdings generally do not change between rebalancing

**Summary:** ## ETFs vs. Index Mutual Funds: An Overview

Both exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index mutual funds are popular forms of [passive investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp), a term for an investment strategy that aims to match—not beat—the performance of a benchmark. Such passive strategies may use ETFs and index mutual funds to replicate the performance of a financial market index, such as the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp). [...] Of note, passive strategies that involve [ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and index mutual funds have grown dramatically in popularity versus active strategies. That's not only due to the cost benefits of lower management fees, but also to higher returns on investment. [...] The investing strategy behind an index fund—whether ETF or mutual fund—is that a portfolio that matches the composition of a certain index (without variation) will also match the performance of that index. Moreover, the overall market will outperform any single investment over the long term.
