**Relevance Score:** 77.1%

**Summary:** Overall risk in our portfolio is lower than in late 2024 given the potential for further volatility as markets calibrate the impact of tariffs. Nevertheless, we are optimistic that as the policy trajectory becomes clearer, and the focus moves towards the tax and deregulation agenda, we will find opportunities to add risk. Should tariff debates resolve without descending into tit-for-tat trade disputes confidence could rebound steadily over the second quarter. [...] Cooling growth but limited recession risk in the U.S. is a positive backdrop for credit. Spreads are optically tight but all in yields remain attractive in high yield and credit fundamentals such as interest coverage are solid. Low defaults and strong demand in primary markets further increase our conviction that credit will perform well this year. We see U.S. 10-year Treasury yields in a trading range between 3.75% and 5.50% for the time being and we find value in duration at current levels. [...] *   **Real estate demand and capital inflows picking up, return potential and inflation hedging qualities are attractive.**
*   **Key risks: Resurgence of inflation, unduly hawkish Fed, tariffs, labor market weakness, and sharp tightening of credit conditions.**
