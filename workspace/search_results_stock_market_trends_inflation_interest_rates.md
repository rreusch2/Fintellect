If stock prices decline, it may indicate investors are seeking to reduce portfolio risk and putting more money to work in [...] Even as stock markets continue trending up, certain market sectors are more susceptible to higher rates. “Interest rate sensitive sectors like utilities and real estate lost ground in late 2024 given the trend of higher Treasury bond yields,” notes Haworth. When Fed rate cuts were on the horizon in the third quarter, small-cap, utilities and real estate stocks performed well.

##### Trendlines [...] We should generally expect that when interest rates are relatively high, stocks should be relatively low. What ought to be very interesting to us is when interest rates and stock prices are in the same phase (both high or both low, relative to their respective trend lines). Since we are already expressing data in both charts in terms of standard deviations above/below trend, we can just sum the two charts together to see where they are out of phase.

## Result 5: How Do Interest Rates Affect the Stock Market? - Investopedia

**Relevance Score:** 52.8%

**Summary:** ## The Bottom Line

The relationship between interest rates and the stock market is fairly indirect but the two tend to move in opposite directions. When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it generally causes the stock market to go up. When it raises interest rates, it causes the stock market to go down. There's no guarantee how the market will react to any given interest rate change, however. [...] The stock market greeted the news by going up in the standard indexes in September 2024 when the Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point cut and many had expected only 25 basis points.

### Fast Fact

The FOMC increased the fed funds rate over time to combat high inflation, from 0.25% in March 2022 to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% in July 2023. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, bringing it to a range of 4.75% to 5%. [...] Michael Nagle / Getty Images

Events since 2020 have highlighted the significant impact of interest rate changes on market behavior. These two forces generally move in opposite directions with rising rates typically causing downward pressure on stock prices. Falling rates tend to boost the market. The relationship isn't that simple, however.
