**Summary:** There is not a direct correlation on the direction of interest rates stemming from stock market movement. The state of the economy and inflation are bigger factors that help determine the direction of interest rates. In many circumstances, interest rate movements can affect stock prices. The biggest impact stock prices have on interest rates is on the demand for bonds. If stock prices decline, it may indicate investors are seeking to reduce portfolio risk and putting more money to work in [...] Even as stock markets continue trending up, certain market sectors are more susceptible to higher rates. “Interest rate sensitive sectors like utilities and real estate lost ground in late 2024 given the trend of higher Treasury bond yields,” notes Haworth. When Fed rate cuts were on the horizon in the third quarter, small-cap, utilities and real estate stocks performed well.

## Result 3: How Does Inflation Affect the Stock Market and Share Prices? - IG

**Relevance Score:** 65.0%

**Summary:** As lower inflation is associated with lower interest rates and increased spending, the demand for shares grows as companies show strong revenues – this results in share price appreciation. Lower inflation is also good news for stocks with lower, but reliable, dividend pay-outs. That’s because the more modest the rate of inflation, the higher the real interest earned per payment. [...] Conversely, when inflation is low, interest rates may also drop – acting as an incentive to spend on investment. As can be seen in the above graph, in the business cycle, growth is intimately linked with both a lower interest rate and lower inflation.

The implication is relatively straightforward: when consumers and businesses spend, general economic growth should result, on the whole, in solid returns on equity, whether through dividends or share price appreciation. [...] For example, if the dividend is 5% and inflation is 3%, then the real interest is 2%. But, if inflation is 1%, then the real interest is 4%. The same goes for stocks with higher amounts of risk – both could experience an increase in demand, resulting in higher prices.
